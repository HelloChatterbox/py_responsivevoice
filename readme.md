Unofficial python API for [Responsive Voice](https://responsivevoice.org)

## Install
```python
pip install responsivevoice
```
## Example

```python
from responsive_voice import ResponsiveVoice

engine = ResponsiveVoice()
engine.say("hello world")

engine = ResponsiveVoice(rate=0.4, vol=0.8)

engine.say("hello world", gender=ResponsiveVoice.MALE, lang=ResponsiveVoice.ENGLISH_US)

file_path = engine.get_mp3(u"ola mundo", lang=ResponsiveVoice.PORTUGESE_PT)

engine.play_mp3(file_path)
```
## Usage
```python
get_mp3(text, mp3_file=None, lang=None, pitch=None, rate=None, vol=None, gender=None)
```
- *text* : The text you want to speak.
- *mp3_file* : The name of the output file. If `None`, this will be generated from the text.
- *lang* : The language of the speaker. E.g. `ResponsiveVoice.ENGLISH_US`
- *pitch* : The pitch of the speaker.
- *rate* : The rate (speed) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *vol* : The volume (loudness) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *gender* : The gender of the speaker. E.g. `ResponsiveVoice.FEMALE`

```python
say(self, text, mp3_file=None, lang=None, pitch=None, rate=None, vol=None, gender=None, play_cmd="mpg123 -q %1")
```
- *text* : The text you want to speak.
- *mp3_file* : The name of the output file. If `None`, a temporary file will be created and the text will be played in blocking mode. Otherwise it will be played without blocking.
- *lang* : The language of the speaker. E.g. `ResponsiveVoice.ENGLISH_US`
- *pitch* : The pitch of the speaker.
- *rate* : The rate (speed) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *vol* : The volume (loudness) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *gender* : The gender of the speaker. E.g. `ResponsiveVoice.FEMALE`
- *play_cmd* : The command used to play the file.

```python
play_mp3(self, mp3_file, play_cmd="mpg123 -q %1", blocking=False)
```
- *mp3_file* : The name of the mp3 file you want to play.
- *play_cmd* : The command used to play the file.
- *blocking* : Wether the program should wait until speaking is finished or not.
