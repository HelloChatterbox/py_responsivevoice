```
## Usage
```python
say(sentence, mp3_file=None, lang=None, pitch=None, rate=None, vol=None, gender=None, play_cmd="mpg123 %1", blocking=True)
```
- *sentence* : The text you want to speak.
- *mp3_file* : The name of the output file. If `None`, a temporary file will be created and the text will be played in blocking mode. Otherwise it will be played without blocking.
- *pitch* : The pitch of the speaker.
- *rate* : The rate (speed) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *vol* : The volume (loudness) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *gender* : The gender of the speaker. E.g. `ResponsiveVoice.FEMALE`
- *play_cmd* : The command used to play the file.
- *blocking* : Wether the program should wait until speaking is finished or not.

```python
play_mp3(mp3_file, play_cmd="mpg123 %1", blocking=False)
```
- *mp3_file* : The name of the mp3 file you want to play.
- *play_cmd* : The command used to play the file (Ignored for Windows OS. Library playsound would be used).
- *blocking* : Whether the program should wait until playback is finished or not.

```python
get_mp3(sentence, mp3_file=None, lang=None, pitch=None, rate=None, vol=None, gender=None)
```
- *sentence* : The text you want to speak.
- *mp3_file* : The name of the output file. If `None`, this will be generated from the text.
- *pitch* : The pitch of the speaker.
- *rate* : The rate (speed) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
- *vol* : The volume (loudness) of the speaker, value between 0 and 1.
